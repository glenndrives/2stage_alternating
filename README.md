# 2stage_alternating
Arduino code for a 2 stage AC unit controller alternating lead lag with each demand

This is a project that controls two a/c units in a lead - lag configuration. After each demand the Lead unit switches to the Lag
unit to even out runtime. 

It also incorporates hold-off and minimum run times to prevent short cycling.
